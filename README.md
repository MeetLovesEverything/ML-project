# Multilingual Speech Recognition

This project aims to develop a robust multilingual speech recognition system capable of accurately transcribing audio inputs in multiple languages.
Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the system is designed to handle diverse linguistic inputs, making it suitable for applications like virtual assistants, transcription services, and language translation tools.

## Features

- **Multilingual Support**: Recognizes and transcribes speech in multiple languages.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes state-of-the-art ML models for speech-to-text conversion.
- **Mobile Application**: Includes a mobile app interface for real-time speech recognition.
- **Chatbot Functionality**: Integrates a chatbot for interactive user engagement.
- **Training Module**: Provides scripts and tools for training custom speech recognition models.
